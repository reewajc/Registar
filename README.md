# Registar

Include these steps:
Need a student class with last name, first name, ID ( you can revise College Student or not..)
Student class needs to be in it's own file.
Roster will have a linked list of students, raw data file is attached.
Registrar should be given a choice to see the entries in the original order, sort on last name, or sort on ID, and see the data displayed.
Registrar should control whether or not they have finished sorting.
